# Shopify App Template Using Vue ðŸŸ¢

This is a template for building Shopify apps using Vue.js as the frontend. It is based on the [Shopify App Node](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node) template. If you would like to use React instead, check out [Creating a shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).

Nothing modified on the backend, uses the same starter template from the one generated from shopify cli.ðŸ”¥
